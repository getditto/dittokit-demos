# DittoSyncKit Demos

This repo contains demo apps that demonstrate how to use DittoSyncKit.

## What is DittoSyncKit?

DittoSyncKit is a peer-to-peer data synchronization library that enables apps to
sync with or even without the internet. The library is cross-platform and
provides a local JSON-compatible database which is synchronized automatically
with other devices over various network transports, including WiFi and
Bluetooth.
